# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project to learn about and familiarize myself with the fundamentals of web development and gain understanding of how to set up a project in GitHub.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about the functions/roles of each topic in web development. For instance, it describes how HTML is used to create the head element that contains information about the webpage and the body element as well. The DevTools console in the project also tells the viewers what topics we learned from prework and lists one topic to study first.
